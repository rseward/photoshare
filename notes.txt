Prepping for the photo re-org (to make it more Apple import friendly).

Working on a feature to identify files that have been moved from the re-org.

Need a sample_files.py utility to sample X files from a directory structure.
  - E.g.: sample_files.py srcdir dstdir -n 300
  - Preserve the directory structure of the sampled files.
  - Sample X files at random from the root directory.
  - Provide a summary of the number of files sampled.

Once I have a sampling of such files.
  - Create a photoshare of the files.
  - Tag some files.
  - Re-org the photos using the photo-organizer script
  - Re-index the photos to test md5sum index preservation feature.

```bash
pip install photo-organizer

#Backup photoshare.db
cp photoshare.db sample/
photo-organizer -r sample/ neat/
copytags sample/ neat/

# Reindex reorganized photos. Starting photoshare should do it. Watch for the indexer to finish.

# Restore tags
./copytags sample/photoshare.db photoshare.db
```
Success photos should be reorganized and have their tags restored.
