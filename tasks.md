# Project

A simple lightweight web photosharing app

## Pending Tasks

- Load and display any tags created for a photo when displaying the photo on the index.html page
- Create a /photos/bytag/{tag} end point. Randomly select a photo with that tag to send to the calling entity. E.g. this endpoint is used to create a slideshow of random photos matching that tag.
